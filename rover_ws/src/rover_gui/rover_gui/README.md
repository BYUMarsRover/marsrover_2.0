TODO: Add an autonomy GUI here

We should keep it simple as possible (to limit network traffic, improve user experience), so just:
DISPLAYS:
- A list of waypoints (w info)
- Feedback from the task execution action server
BUTTONS:
- Add a specific waypoint (select type, tag number, object, etc)
- Remove a specific waypoint
- Clear all waypoints
- Send waypoints
- Stop
